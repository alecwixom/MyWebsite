                    Hi there! I'm Alec Wixom, a passionate and creative React developer
                    based in Orem, Utah. I love building interactive and user-friendly
                    web applications that bring ideas to life.
                    With 2 years of experience in web development, I have gained expertise
                    in using React and other front-end technologies to deliver seamless
                    user experiences. My strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                    allows me to develop efficient and scalable applications.
                    I am a problem solver at heart, and I enjoy collaborating with teams
                    to tackle challenges and find innovative solutions. My attention to
                    detail and dedication to writing clean, maintainable code have been
                    essential in delivering successful projects on time.
                    When I'm not coding, you can find me playing games, camping and going
                    on drives.
